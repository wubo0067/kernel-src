	  An arch should select this symbol if it supports building with

	  GCC plugins are loadable modules that provide extra features to the
	  compiler. They are useful for runtime instrumentation and static analysis.

	  See Documentation/kbuild/gcc-plugins.rst for details.

config GCC_PLUGIN_CYC_COMPLEXITY
	bool "Compute the cyclomatic complexity of a function" if EXPERT
	depends on !COMPILE_TEST	# too noisy
	help
	  The complexity M of a function's control flow graph is defined as:
	   M = E - N + 2P
	  where

	  E = the number of edges
	  N = the number of nodes
	  P = the number of connected components (exit nodes).

	  Enabling this plugin reports the complexity to stderr during the
	  build. It mainly serves as a simple example of how to create a
	  gcc plugin for the kernel.

config GCC_PLUGIN_SANCOV
	bool
	help
	  This plugin inserts a __sanitizer_cov_trace_pc() call at the start of
	  basic blocks. It supports all gcc versions with plugin support (from
	  gcc-4.5 on). It is based on the commit "Add fuzzing coverage support"
	  by Dmitry Vyukov <dvyukov@google.com>.

config GCC_PLUGIN_LATENT_ENTROPY
	bool "Generate some entropy during boot and runtime"
	help
	  By saying Y here the kernel will instrument some kernel code to
	  extract some entropy from both original and artificially created
	  program state.  This will help especially embedded systems where
	  there is little 'natural' source of entropy normally.  The cost
	  is some slowdown of the boot process (about 0.5%) and fork and
	  irq processing.

	  Note that entropy extracted this way is not cryptographically
	  secure!

	  This plugin was ported from grsecurity/PaX. More information at:
